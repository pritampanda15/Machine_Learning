    "### What is molecular generation? \n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular generation is one of the most fundamental challenges in drug discovery that is to identify one or more molecules with a specific set of properties of interest, such as binding affinity and drug-likeness. Generative algorithms, compared to high-throughput (virtual) screening which is to experimentally (computationally) evaluate every candidate in a library, have an advantage of exploring the chemical space selectively and avoiding enumerating the whole chemical space. Further, the generative algorithms can explore chemical space beyond the limited beginning pool and provide novel chemical structures with preferential intellectual property positions, whereas molecules in screening are often pre-existing. Current generative algorithm can be divided into two classes: distribution learning and goal-directed generation. Distribution learning models are meant to interpolate within a chemical space comprised of a training set of molecules and to generate new molecules with similar properties (e.g., variational encoder, generative adversarial network). Goal-directed generations try to generate new molecules that maximize an oracle function (e.g., generich algorithm, reinforcement learning). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is metric function? \n",
    "\n",
    "A metric function is to evaluate the output of distribution learning. In distribution learning tasks, we approximate an unknown distribution $p(x)$ with some distribution $q(x)$ based on a set of molecules sampled from $p(x)$. A well-trained model generates diverse and unique molecules that can be used for building a tailored virtual library. Thus metric functions evaluate the quality of a batch of molecules and the deviation between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. Note our current metric functions are adopted from MOSES benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is oracle? \n",
    "\n",
    "An oracle is a black box that evaluates the ground truth score for input molecule(s). In goal-directed molecular generation tasks, a computational scoring function is usually used as a surrogate oracle to assess how much the molecules fulfill the requirements, such as inhibiting (e.g., Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta, GSK3B) or drug-likeliness (e.g., QED). The objective of the goal-directed molecular generation is to propose molecules maximizing such scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of TDC oracle and after this tutorial, you will be able to leverage most of the useful oracles supported!\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you have familiarize yourself with the installations and data loaders. If not, please visit [TDC 101 Data Loaders](https://github.com/mims-harvard/TDC/blob/master/tutorials/TDC_101_Data_Loader.ipynb) first!\n",

    "We will first introduce metric functions, then introduce oracles and some advanced usage of oracles.\n"
